    <h2>My Self</h2>
    <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. <br>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. <br>I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, <br>I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p>

<p>I, personally, have many hobbies, ranging from creative hobbies (watercolors and crafting),<br> to active hobbies (barre and pilates) and mental/spiritual hobbies<br> (yoga and reading).

    Hobbies have enriched my life, made me happier, <br>and helped me become an interesting, well-rounded person.</p>

<h2>Favorites</h2>

<img src="elmerto3.jpg" alt="Favorites" height="150">


<p>Everyone has a favorite person. Some people think that could be a fictional character in a novel.<br> Others would like to choose an actor, a singer, or a famous politician.<br> For me, my favorite person is a family member, my older sister,<br> because she is generous, compassionate, and reliable.
    My sister is very generous.</p>

<h2>Friends</h2>
<p>The adventure of life becomes beautiful when good friends surround us. We all belong to a family, <br>where we have our parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, etc.<br> We get immense love, care, attention and guidance from our family. However, our entire life does <br>not revolve around our family members only. We all have our own purpose in life. </p>
