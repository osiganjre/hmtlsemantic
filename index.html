<h2>Favorites</h2>

<img src="elmerto3.jpg" alt="Favorites" height="150">


<p>Everyone has a favorite person. Some people think that could be a fictional character in a novel.<br> Others would like to choose an actor, a singer, or a famous politician.<br> For me, my favorite person is a family member, my older sister,<br> because she is generous, compassionate, and reliable.
    My sister is very generous.</p>
