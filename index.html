    <h2>My Self</h2>
    <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. <br>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. <br>I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, <br>I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p>

<h2>Favorites</h2>

<img src="elmerto3.jpg" alt="Favorites">


<p>Everyone has a favorite person. Some people think that could be a fictional character in a novel.<br> Others would like to choose an actor, a singer, or a famous politician.<br> For me, my favorite person is a family member, my older sister,<br> because she is generous, compassionate, and reliable.
    My sister is very generous. First, she was willing to let me borrow<br> her belongings when I was in need. She also understood and forgave me when <br>> made small mistakes. For example, she lent me her favorite long dress so that I could wear it to my Senior Prom. <br>Because of my carelessness, her expensive dress was ripped at the bottom. <br>I worried that she would be upset and mad at me. However, she did not blame me knowing that.<br> She even hugged me and asked me lovingly about the prom.<br> Moreover, she dedicates her time to help me study. When I was in high school, she taught me English herself, and often bought me many reference books. <br>I am grateful to have an unselfish sister.
    <br>Another reason my older sister is my favorite sister is that she is compassionate. <br>She has great sympathy for other people’s suffering. For instance, she often tries to help poor and homeless people by donating food, clothes, money, etc. <Br>She used to work as a volunteer for in a school for the blind children in Vietnam. I still remember when I saw her taught those children to read by touching the special characters. She patiently held her students ’  hand and instructed them. <br>Although it was not an easy job, her face was always radiant with smiles. <br>She often told me to give what I got, and to feel happy helping others.<br> My sister cares deeply about other people more than herself.</p>

<h2>Friends</h2>
<p>The adventure of life becomes beautiful when good friends surround us. We all belong to a family, <br>where we have our parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, etc.<br> We get immense love, care, attention and guidance from our family. However, our entire life does not revolve around our family members only. We all have our own purpose in life. <br>Some members of our family go to school, some go to college, <br>and our parents go to work. We all have a life outside our family.</p>
